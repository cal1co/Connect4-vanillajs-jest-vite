# A simple console-based Connect 4 game

## Features
- Single and Multiplayer gamemodes
- Ascii game board
- Player prompts 
- Error messages for invalid moves
- Colourful logs for readability

## Limitations
- Time: Due to complications, I couldn't implement some features (see goals).

## Goals 
- Implement Minimax decision algorithm to beef up the competition. Alpha-beta pruning should be used along side other optimisation techniques such as a transposition table. My experience with the algorithm and these techniques have been successful in the past with tic-tac-toe. However, Connect Four is an infintely more complex game. 
- Further DRY up code and refactor where applicable. Readability can also be improved.
